# Excel Homework: Kickstart My Chart

1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
- Feb, May, and June have the most number of successful campaign starts. Jan, Jun, Jul, and Oct have the most number of failed campaign starts. 
- The percentage of successful campaigns decrease as the size of the goal increases. 
- Theaters and plays projects have the most submissions in Kickstarter. 

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
It doesn't tell you when backers donated their money during the campaign. 
It doesn't provide information about donation amounts other than the average. (min, max, var, stddev)
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could examine whether the country of origin or staff pick status made any difference on the success of the campaign. 

## Bonus

* Create a new sheet with 8 columns:

  * `Goal`
  * `Number Successful`
  * `Number Failed`
  * `Number Canceled`
  * `Total Projects`
  * `Percentage Successful`
  * `Percentage Failed`
  * `Percentage Canceled`

* In the `Goal` column, create 12 rows with the following headers:

  * Less than 1000
  * 1000 to 4999
  * 5000 to 9999
  * 10000 to 14999
  * 15000 to 19999
  * 20000 to 24999
  * 25000 to 29999
  * 30000 to 34999
  * 35000 to 39999
  * 40000 to 44999
  * 45000 to 49999
  * Greater than or equal to 50000

* Using the `COUNTIFS()` formula, count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within the ranges listed above. Populate the `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, and `Number Canceled` columns with this data.

* Add up each of the values in the `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, and `Number Canceled` columns to populate the `Total Projects` column. Then, using a mathematical formula, find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.

* Create a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.

## Bonus Statistical Analysis

If one were to describe a successful crowdfunding campaign, most people would use the number of campaign backers as a metric of success. One of the most efficient ways that data scientists characterize a quantitative metric, such as the number of campaign backers, is by creating a summary statistics table.

For those looking for an additional challenge, you will evaluate the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns by creating **your own** summary statistics table.

* Create a new worksheet in your workbook, and create a column each for the number of backers of successful campaigns and unsuccessful campaigns.

  ![Images/backers01.png](Images/backers01.png)

* Use Excel to evaluate the following for successful campaigns, and then for unsuccessful campaigns:

  * The mean number of backers.

  * The median number of backers.

  * The minimum number of backers.

  * The maximum number of backers.

  * The variance of the number of backers.

  * The standard deviation of the number of backers.

* Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.

* Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

## Submission

* To submit your homework, upload the solution and files to a GitHub repo and submit the link to <https://bootcampspot.com/>.
